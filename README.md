Groupbuy +1 system 
Hi This is my firstself-directed project to build my order collating system for my GroupBuy business. 
I'll be using python, PostgreSQL and cloud services for queue system for the basic functions such as identifying +1, user informations and order details in the messages to store in my database.
This is to try out the GitHub function so not all the codes will be uploaded here because I'm planning to patent my system (hopefully)!
